	Visual and Language cues are very useful for understanding the environment around us.For AI it is also imperative to be able to use text and images to reason about the situation that they are in. Even when using the latest advancements in DL, RL, CV, etc. we still have a lot of ground to conquer to achieve great results. That holds true especially when we test our models in a real-life environment. Research on this field is now getting more focus. End-to-End Module Networks(N2NMN) is an example of such research which have achieve promising results. Building conversational AI that can communicate with us using communication channels that are natural to us is a great challenge.
